# Mystery Message Maker

This is a fun way to practice arithmetic while decoding a secret message.

You can create your own messages to be solved online, or print them out as a worksheet to be done with pencil and paper.

### About:
I have a 1st grader who enjoys learning to read, but math is a struggle.

Attempts to get her to practice were pushing her into a attitude that she "hates math". Workbooks were too tedious and
the iPad Apps I found did little to make it fun.

I'm not sure where the idea came from, but one day I hand-made a "mystery message" on paper for her with addition
problems and she loved it. She asked for another one. After that I made this online generator and the first time we
used it she asked to make five of them in a row, diligently working though each of them one by one.

I hope it sparks the same enthusiasm in other kids out there.
